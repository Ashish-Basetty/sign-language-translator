# sign-language-translator
YOLOv8 computer vision model designed to translate sign language alphabet characters into letters. Trained on data from me in my room!
Built using pytorch and ultralytic's YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) classifier model. Samples were taken and videos analyzed using OpenCV's 
Python interface, and data was labeled using HumanSignal's labelImg software. Not completely refined due to training hardware constraints
and a small dataset, but mostly effective on most letters!
